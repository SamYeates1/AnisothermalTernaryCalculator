This script allows the user to generate csv files containing ternary datasets, comprising of the phases present at a 
temperature(k) and elemental ratios (Mass%) ternary point. It can be used for metallic ternary systems, or for 
'psuedo-ternaries' (E.g. V-4Cr-4Ti;C;N). It is designed to be used in conjunction with a second script;
Anisothermal Plotter.

This code was written by Sam Yeates(The University of Sheffield) as part of his PhD, supervised by Prof. Russell Goodall 
and Prof. Katerina Christofidou. Assistance in ThermoCalc handling was given by Carl-Magnus Lancelot(ThermoCalc Software AB)  
This version of the script was finalised on 11/06/2025.

DISCLAIMER - This code does not carry out any CALPHAD or Thermodynamic modelling. It purely uses TC_Python to generate
phase data based on ThermoCalc calculations and databases. Therefore data outputted from this code is only ever as accurate
as ThermoCalc. Users should ensure they  validate any results to the accuracy/detail their work requires. 
This tool is designed first and foremost as a way to visualise systems to allow for first-pass alloy design or for 
scientific communication purposes. It is not designed to act as a precise or accurate design tool.

"""This section is where you set up your (psuedo)ternary calculation. Open for set-up instructions

    First, select a suitible databse, and check which database is most suitible for your elemental range.
    WARNING - This code will make no checks for this.

    Second, create your temperature range and step size in Kelvin. In the authors experience, a Tres of 25k gives a good starting visual
    WARNING - ThermoCalc is anecdotatly poor below 600K, so be wary of setting your temp range below this.
    
    Third, set up your axis. Due to the way ThermoCalc works, there must always be a 'balance' element. This is to prevent the equation 
    becoming overdefined due to insufficient degrees of freedom. Depending on what you are wishing to investigate, there are two ways to 
    approach this.

    
    1) For Metallic True Ternary (E.g. V-Cr-Ti)
        Axis One defines your 'balance' element. 
        A1Es should take a list with a single str input of the desired element, e.g. A1Es = ["V"]
        A1EComps should take a list with a single value of 1.0, e.g. A1EComps = [1.0]
        
        Axis Two and Three are where you define your other two elements. You also define your compositional range and resolution here.
        For a typical Metallic True Ternary, you would expect the range to be 0-100wt% for each element, and an axis composition of 1.0
        Therefore 
        
        A2Es = ["Cr"]
        A2EComps = [1.0]
        A2min takes a float equal to the min wt%, e.g. A2min = 0.0
        A2max takes a float equal to the max. wt%, e.g. = 100.00
        A2res takes a float equal to the wt% step desired, e.g. A2res = 1.0 
            ;The author has recommend not going higher than 5wt%  for fast runs, or lower than 1wt%  for higher resolution.
            Should the user have signficant time, computational power, or need, this code can go to finer resolution.
    
        For this current software version, axis 2 and 3 must have matching ranges and resolutions. For a Metallic, this can either mean:
            
        A3Es = ["Ti"]
        A3EComps = [1.00] 
        A3min = 0.000
        A3max = 100.00
        A3res = 1.0
            
        or 
        
        A3Es = ["Ti"]
        A3EComps = A2EComps
        A3min = A2min
        A3max = A2max
        A3res = A2res
"""
"""

    2) For Psuedo Ternaries (E.g. V4Cr4Ti-CN-O)
        This approach is designed to allow analysis of impurity elements on metallic ternaries, or probe higher compositional spaces,
        such as commonly probed for HEAs/CCAs. However it requires care in strucutre as ThermoCalc must be fed the elements in the 
        correct way. 
        
        There are now several sets of compositions, one of each 'corner' of the ternary space. For example, if we take V4Cr4Ti-O-N we have the ratio of
            92wt% V : 4wt% Cr : 4wt% Ti
            50wt% C : 50wt% N
            100wt% O
        
        This refers to the idea of the metallic ternary V-4Cr-4Ti, with impurities where C and N are always equal, and O is considered seperately. 
        For the above statement to be true, the ratios shown above must be fixed. We do this using the AXEComps list. 
        We can then further vary the ammount of Axis Two and Axis Three's components through use of the AXmin,max and res, as we would for a metallic ternary. The
        simplest way to conceptualise this is that Axis One is your 'base' and you are adding in Axis Two and Three in varying ammounts. This is how this
        code is set up to run, by varying the concetration of Axis Two and Three Components, while holding the relative ratios of each axis constituent constant.
        
        WARNING - For this version of the script, Axis One and Two must vary in the same amount
        
        As an example in setting this up, let us consider the V4Cr4Ti-CN-O psuedo ternary, where we probe the 0-0.1wt% inclusion of CN and O, at a resolution
        of 0.001wt% (I.e. we will have 100 points of each axis). As above, our components are: 
        
            1) V-4Cr-4Ti
            2) C-N
            3) O
        at component ratios of:
            
            1) 92wt% V : 4wt% Cr : 4wt% Ti
            2) 50wt% C : 50wt% N
            3) 100wt% O            
        at axis ratios of:
            
            1) 99.8wt%-100wt%
            2) 0-0.1wt%
            3) 0-0.1wt%
        
        
        Axis One defines your 'balance' component. 
        A1Es should take a list of  strings of the desired elements, e.g. A1Es = ["V","Cr","Ti"]
        A1EComps should take a list of floats of the desired component mass fractions, e.g. A1EComps = [0.92,0.04,0.04]
        
        Axis Two and Three are where you define your other two components. You also define your axis range and resolution here.
        
        A2Es = ["C","N"]
        A2EComps = [0.5,0.5]
        A2min takes a float equal to the min wt%, e.g. A2min = 0.0
        A2max takes a float equal to the max. wt%, e.g. = 0.1
        A2res takes a float equal to the wt% step desired, e.g. A2res = 0.001 
             (The author has recommend not going less than 20 steps (5.0wt% for a 100wt range,0.05wt% for a 1wt% range,0.005wt% 
             for a 0.1wt% range)for fast runs, or more than 100 steps (1.0wt% for a 100wt range,0.01wt% for a 1wt% range,0.001wt% 
             for a 0.1wt% range)for higher resolution. Should the user have signficant time, computational power, or need, this 
             code can go to finer resolution.)
    
        For this current software version, axis 2 and 3 must have matching ranges and resolutions. For a Metallic, this can either mean:
